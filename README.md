## Dataset

**[PPG-DaLiA](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/PPG-DaLiA)** is a publicly available dataset for PPG-based heart rate estimation. This multimodal dataset features physiological and motion data, recorded from both a wrist- and a chest-worn device, of 15 subjects while performing a wide range of activities under close to real-life conditions. The included ECG data provides heart rate ground truth. The included PPG- and 3D-accelerometer data can be used for heart rate estimation, while compensating for motion artefacts.

## Project

The project aimed at predicting the activity based on the different captors and subject features. Since the dataset provides the data for only 15 subjects, I aimed my study at looking how the model developed would perform on unseen data.
